ROBOT GUI

Haritha Mohan

Red Ventures Technical Assessment

In this project, I created a graphical user interface using Java that
 allows users to choose a name and type for their robot. Next, the
 robot will complete a set of 5 randomly chosen tasks from a "To Do"
 list. As the tasks are being completed, a corresponding gif will
 appear on the GUI and the program will pause for the time it takes
 for the robot to complete the task. Once the task is completed, the
 task will appear in the completed section of the GUI. 
 After the robot has finished 5 tasks, a message indicating completion will 
 appear to the user.
 
 I created this application using the Swing library which provided many useful assets for
 creating the user interface. For the technical components of the program,
 I utilized many object oriented programming techniques such as constructors and instance variables
 to maximize efficiency.
 
 To run this application, please make sure to download all the necessary 
 files into your IDE and run the main method from the RobotGUI class.
